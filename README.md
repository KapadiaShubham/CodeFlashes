# CodeFlashes
A simple website having FrontEnd only, to make notes/Short notes of whatever topics I learn.
I have also added prism's code snippets to easily copy from stuffs used in past to apply in future projects.

This website will also contain some bookmarks and links to refer to the INFO source at anytime,
so that you won't have to waste your time again for finding it.

Use Prism.js for code blocks.
